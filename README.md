## Day 1: DApps
-How DApps are developed.
-Learnt that DApps can be written in an OOP language (solidity) in the Ethereum blockchain.
-Differences between web3.0 and web2.0
-The DApp you want to build will determine what type of blockchain you opt for private or public.
## Day 2:Contracts
-Solidity is a contract oriented language highly influenced by Python,C++ & JavaScript.
-Wrote my first contract code,you first specify the version of solidity using terms 
Pragma solidity (and the version)
-All the variables live in the contract braces.
## Day 3:Contracts continuation...
-In other OOP languages a class is a blueprint for creating objects,in solidity a contract is like a class.
-You can inherit from a contract to share a common interface 
## Day 4: IDEs & Smart Contracts
-Learnt how to use the Remix ide( for the 50th timeRolling on the floor laughing) it's the best IDE for writing,compiling and deploying smart contracts. You can also use VScode save your file with a .sol extension
-How IPFS can be used to store files.
-IPFS to search for files in a specific node
-Datatypes(string,uint,uint8,byte32,int,and address)Structs,Arrays.
## Day 5: Data types in-depth and DataStructures
-Differences between uint8,uint and uint256
✓uint256 is used if the number needs to be big.
✓uint8 is used to optimize performance.uint example:
uint count = 0;
-Structs are custom data structures.
Struct example
you start with the keyword struct.
```
struct person{
     uint ID;
     string name;
}
```
